# CRMVSC - Co-Regularized Multi-View Spectral Clustering

Python implementation of the Co-Regularized Multi-view Spectral Clustering algorithm by Kumar, Rai, and Daumé.[[1]](#1)

This implementation is meant for analyzing and plotting the results of the algorithm at different points in time and trying out
varying Laplace matrices.
If you are simply interested in getting the end results, please refer to the following package: https://github.com/mvlearn

## Installation
- Python Version: 3.8
- Required packages: See requirements.txt
- To access the provided functions in another project, use pip install git+[project-url] and import them.
